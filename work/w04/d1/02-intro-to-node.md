## What is Node.js?

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/nXTOu8F.jpg">

- **Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript outside of the browser!**

- Created in 2009 by Ryan Dahl with Joyent, Inc.

- Uses the same _V8 JavaScript Engine_ used in the Chrome browser to compile JS programs into machine code.

- Node's runtime environment for JS is different than that in the browser, primarily because:
	- It doesn't have the browser's DOM or [Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API).
	- Node has low-level networking and file system APIs that browser JS does not (for security reasons).

- In addition to being used to build high-performance web applications, Node is also a great tool for building command-line tools.

- Node is an open source project governed by the [OpenJSFoundation/Node.js Foundation](https://foundation.nodejs.org/) with board representation from companies such as:

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/8fZqO3E.png">

- Node is very "lightweight", i.e., only low-level "core" modules for networking, filesystem access, etc. are baked-in.

- Node's functionality is extended via open source libraries called packages.  These packages are managed using the `npm` command installed with Node.

- Node's package ecosystem is the largest open source ecosystem in the world.

## Node's REPL

- **REPL** is an acronym for Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop.

- Programming languages such as Python and Ruby also have REPLs.

- To start [Node's interactive REPL](https://nodejs.org/api/repl.html) we type `node` in Terminal.

- In the REPL we can write JS and even load Node modules, which we're going to learn about in this lesson:

	```sh
	> 10 + 5
	15
	> function sayHello() {
	... console.log('Hello');
	... }
	undefined
	> sayHello()
	Hello
	undefined
	> const http = require('http');
	undefined
	> http
	[ a large JS object representing Node's 'http' module ]
	```

- Press `control-c` twice to exit REPL.

## Why the Enthusiasm for Node.js?

- First and foremost, **performance** - businesses can handle more traffic with less hardware!

- Secondly, developer **synergy**. Developers can use JavaScript on both client & server, thus becoming a full-stack dev is more obtainable and companies can better utilize their developer resources across the front and back-ends.

- The improvements in server performance and developer productivity result in **businesses saving money**.

- Businesses saving money results in **wide adoption**:

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5nvUBa3.jpg">

	Most importantly, wide adoption of Node.js results in strong demand for Node developers!

## Why is Node.js so Performant?

- First, it's important to understand how time consuming ("expensive") Input/Output operations are:

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/iXshhYh.jpg">

- Node's **Asynchronous / Event-driven** design enables<br>**non-blocking** Input/Output:

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ARbweHg.jpg">

- A typical Node server is capable of supporting _tens of thousands_ of concurrent connections!

- For more information regarding performance, check the references at the end of this presentation.

### Asynchronous Programming Model

- High-performance, non-blocking I/O operations must be designed as **asynchronous methods**.

- Therefore, a Node developer will use _callback functions_ and/or _promises_ extensively.

## ‚ùì Review Questions - What is Node.js?

1. **Is Node.js a programming language?**

2. **Is...<br>`const el = document.getElementById('my-list');`<br>a valid JavaScript statement in a Node app?**

Now that you've learned how awesome Node is, let's see how it runs JavaScript programs!

## Using Node to Execute JavaScript

- Let's type the following JavaScript in **main.js**:

	```js
	const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;
		
	let n = multiply(5, 8);
		
	console.log(n);
	```

- Press `ctrl + backtick` to open the integrated terminal in VS Code and type the following to execute **main.js**:

	```sh
	$ node main
	40
	```
	Note how you don't need to include the ".js" file extension.
	
- Yes, running a Node app is that easy!

Cool, let's learn about Node Modules...

## Node Modules

Modules in Node allow us to **modularize** and **reuse** code in a Node app.

### Modules Built Into Node

- Node itself comes with several _core modules_, such as the `http` and `fs` modules.

- There are thousands of open-source modules available.

- Let's use the core `fs` module to create a file. Replace the code in **main.js** with this:

	```js
	const fs = require('fs');
	console.log(typeof fs);
	
	fs.writeFile('./hello.txt', 'Hello!', function() {
	  console.log('done creating file');
	});
	```

- We can see that the `fs` module "exports" an `object` that has methods such as `writeFile`.

### Our Own Node Modules

- In a Node application, **every** JavaScript file is a module!

- A Node app's modules (files) can be put in any folder within the project allowing us to create modules inside of aptly named folders, such as `models`, `routes`, `controllers`, `views`, etc.

- A module is "loaded" into a Node app using Node's `require` function we just used to load the `fs` module.

- Let's create a file/module named **days-of-week.js**: `touch days-of-week.js`

- Every Node module has a global `module` object - let's log it out and check out its properties:

	```js
	// days-of-week.js
	
	console.log(module);
	``` 

- Now let's run our Node module by typing<br>`node days-of-week` and check out what's logged.

- We're getting an inside look at how Node implements its module system...

- Each module is uniquely identified by its fully qualified filename (including the folder path). This allows modules to be named the same, as long as they exist in different folders.

- The property on `module` that we're really interested in though is `exports`.

#### `module.exports`

The `exports` property on the `module` variable is used to "export" whatever functionality should be exposed by the module...

#### Exporting a Single Piece of Functionality

- Whatever is assigned to `module.exports` can be accessed by any number of other modules using the `require` function we saw earlier.

- Let's verify this by assigning a string to it:

	```js
	// days-of-week.js
	
	module.exports = 'SEI Rocks!';
	```

- We're going to need another file/module we can use to access the exported functionality: `touch main.js`

- In **main.js**, we can now put the `require` function to work:

	```js
	// main.js
	
	const daysOfWeek = require('./days-of-week');
	console.log(daysOfWeek);  // Will log out "SEI Rocks!"
	```
	Then type `node main` to test it out!

- It is convention to name the variable the same as, or similar to, the name of the module being required. 

- When we require our app's own modules, we need to always provide a relative path, i.e., starting with either a `.` or `..`

- üí™ **You Do:** Instead of exporting a string, change **days-of-week.js** to export the following array instead:

	```js
	['Su', 'Mo', 'Tu', 'We', 'Th', 'Fr', 'Sa']
	```

- Run `node main` again to check it out.

> Key Point:  `require()` returns whatever `module.exports` holds!

- If we updated 

	```js
	// main.js
	
	const daysOfWeek = require('./days-of-week');
	console.log(daysOfWeek);  // Will log out "SEI Rocks!"
	```
  to
	```js
	const daysOfWeek = require('./days-of-week')[1];
	console.log(daysOfWeek);
	```
  **‚ùì What would be logged out?** 

#### Exporting Lot's of Functionality 

- `module.exports` is initialized to an empty object by default allowing us to easily create properties on it.

- Creating properties on `module.exports` is a way to expose multiple pieces of functionality.

- Let's try it out:

	```js	
  // days-of-week.js

  const weekdays = ['Su', 'Mo', 'Tu', 'We', 'Th', 'Fr', 'Sa'];

	module.exports.weekdays = weekdays;
	
	module.exports.getWeekday = function(dayNo) {
	  if (dayNo < 0 || dayNo > 6) dayNo = 0;
	  return weekdays[dayNo];
	};
	```

- Now let's test it in **main.js**:

	```js
	const daysOfWeek = require('./days-of-week');
	
	const day = daysOfWeek.getWeekday(5);
	console.log(day);
	```
	`Fr` should be logged out.

> Key Point:  Again, `require()` returns whatever `module.exports` holds!

- Another common approach to exporting multiple pieces of functionality like above would be to assign a new object like this:

	```js	
  // days-of-week.js

  const weekdays = ['Su', 'Mo', 'Tu', 'We', 'Th', 'Fr', 'Sa'];

  module.exports = {
    weekdays,
    getWeekday
  };
	
  function getWeekday(dayNo) {
	  if (dayNo < 0 || dayNo > 6) dayNo = 0;
	  return weekdays[dayNo];
  }
	```

#### `exports` Shortcut Variable

- Node also provides a "shortcut" variable named `exports` that references that very same object that `module.exports` does.

- For example, could do this:

  ```js
  exports.weekdays = ['Su', 'Mo', 'Tu', 'We', 'Th', 'Fr', 'Sa'];
  ```
  instead of:
  ```js
  module.exports.weekdays = ['Su', 'Mo', 'Tu', 'We', 'Th', 'Fr', 'Sa'];
  ```

- **IMPORTANT:** It is not possible to _**assign**_ functionality to the `exports` shortcut variable because it will stop referencing `module.exports`.

#### Module Miscellaneous

- Since modules are about code reuse, they can be required an unlimited number of times throughout the application.

- The code in the module **only runs the first time the module is required**.<br>Allow me demo this for you.

- Any variables declared within a module are local to the module - they do not pollute the global scope.

- The global scope in a Node application is represented by an object named `global`, **unlike the browser's ________ object**.

## ‚ùì Review Questions - Modules

1. **What are modules used for in Node?**

2. **What object in a Node module can we use to attach or assign functionality to?**

3. **How many times can we `require` a module in our program?**

4. **Why won't the following code work as intended?**

	```js
	// add.js module
	exports = function (x, y) { return x + y };
	```
	and
	 
	```js
	// use the add.js module
	const add = require('./add');
	let sum = add(5, 10);
	```
	
Now that you've created and used your own modules, let's see how we can install open-source packages and use the modules they contain...

## NPM - Node Package Manager

- Node uses a package management system to distribute open-source packages called **N**ode **P**ackage **M**anager (_npm_).

- Usually a package distributes a Node module, however, sometimes the package distributes a CLI instead of a module we would use in our program.

- Node programs use a `package.json` file that tracks the installed modules that the app depends upon.

- Tracking an application's dependencies in `package.json` removes the necessity to push the app's node modules to the projects GitHub repo - this saves **MASSIVE** file storage and bandwidth.

- If you start a Node app from scratch, the first thing you should do is create the `package.json` file by entering the following command:

	```sh
	$ npm init
	```

- It's okay to accept all of the default settings.  To accept the defaults without being prompted, you can run the command as follows:

	```sh
	$ npm init -y
	```

- Now, let's use `npm` to download and install a package:

	```sh
	$ npm install request
	```

- There is now a `node_modules` folder that contains a folder for the `request` module and its many dependencies.

- There's also a new `package-lock.json` file that npm uses to track dependencies and unlike `package.json`, should not be edited.

- Note: it's highly recommended that `node_modules` be added to your `.gitignore` file.

- We can now require the `request` module in **main.js** and make HTTP requests:

	```js
	// Don't specify path when module is in node_modules
	const request = require('request');
	request(
	  'http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users',
	  function(err, res, body) {
	    console.log(body);
	  }
	);
	```
	> Note the first parameter in the callback is `err`.<br>This "error-first" callback signature is prevalent throughout Node.

- Type `node main` to try it out.

- Let's examine the `request()` call a little closer...

- **Why did a callback have to be provided?**

- Examining the `packages.json` file reveals that it's structured something like this:

	```js
	{
	  "name": "first-node",
	  "version": "1.0.0",
	  "description": "",
	  "main": "index.js",
	  "scripts": {
	    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
	  },
	  "author": "Jim Clark <email@jim-clark.com>",
	  "license": "MIT",
	  "dependencies": {
	    "request": "^2.88.0"
	  }
	}
	```

- The `package.json` is used to install a project's dependencies.

- Installing dependencies is necessary after cloning a repo or when using starter code for a lesson. 

- To demonstrate this, first delete the `node_modules` file, then...

- Now we can install our app's dependencies like this:

	```sh
	$ npm install
	```
	Witness the return of `node_modules`!

## Conclusion

- In the next lesson, you will use one of the most popular Node modules, `Express`, that turns Node into a capable web server.

- **Questions?**

- There are a couple of practice exercises following...

### üí™ Practice - Modules #1

Create a module named `random.js`:

1. That has a function **assigned** to the `module.exports` object.
2. The function should define two parameters, `min` & `max`.
3. The function should return a random number, as an integer, between `min` & `max`, inclusive.
4. Test the module in `main.js` like this:
	
	```js
	const random = require('./utilities/random');
	for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
	  console.log( random(100, 200) );
	}
	```

### üí™ Practice - Modules #2

Create a module named `circle.js`:

1. That exports two functions, both of which have a `radius` parameter defined.
2. The functions should be named `area` & `circumference`.
3. The functions should...
	- `area`: Computes the area of a circle (radius squared X Pi), with the radius provided as an argument. 
	- `circumference`: Computes the circumference of a circle (radius X 2 X Pi), with the radius provided as an argument
4. Hint: This is JS, so `Math.PI` is available.
5. Test the module in `main.js` like this:

	```js
	const circle = require('./utilities/circle');
	console.log( circle.area(50) );  // 7853.98...
	console.log( circle.circumference(75) );  // 471.23...
	```
