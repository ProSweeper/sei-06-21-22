# Finch Collector Lab - Part 4

## Intro

Today in the **Django - One:Many Relationships** lesson, you learned how to add another model that demonstrates working with one-to-many relationships in Django. 

In this lab, you'll do the same, except for a data resource of your choosing.

We have chosen to collect Finches in this example!

FYI, future lessons will expand upon the `catcollector` project, and the labs will expand upon the `finchcollector` project!

#### The final version of `finchcollector` (parts 1 thru 5 combined) will be a deliverable, so do each part and don't fall behind.


## Exercises

Following the steps we took in the **Django - One:Many Relationships lesson**, complete the following exercises:

1. Create another model that will have a One:Many relationship with your main data entity.

2. Implement similar functionality to the Feeding model in catcollector, including the following User Stories:
	- AAU, when I visit the `detail` page for a finch, I want to see a list of feedings for that finch.

	- AAU, when I visit the `detail` page for a finch, I want to be able to add a feeding for a finch.

## Bonus

1. Adding a Custom Method to Check the Feeding Status:
	- AAU, when I visit the `detail` page for a finch, I want to see a message displaying a status of 'hungry' or 'fed'.


## Deliverable?

#### The final version of `finchcollector` (parts 1 thru 5 combined) will be a deliverable, so do each part and don't fall behind.

Please create a repo named `finchcollector` and commit your code.

The link to the repo will be submitted using the form as explained in the class readme.
