# Finch Collector Lab - Part 2

## Intro

Today in the **Intro to Django Models** lesson, you replaced the existing Cat class with a proper Cat model, as well as implemented 'Index' and 'Detail' functionality for the Cat data resource.

In this lab, you'll do the same, except for a data resource of your choosing.

We have chosen to collect Finches in this example!

FYI, future lessons will expand upon the `catcollector` project, and the labs will expand upon the `finchcollector` project!

#### The final version of `finchcollector` (parts 1 thru 5 combined) will be a deliverable, so do each part and don't fall behind.

## Exercises

Following the steps we took in the **Intro to Django Models lesson**, complete the following exercises:

1. Create a finch model with at least three properties. Be creative!

2. Using the Python Interactive Shell, create some finches in your database to be rendered on the page.

3. Register the Finch model with the admin portal in `admin.py`.

4. Implement the following User Stories:
	- AAU, when I visit the `All Finches` page, I want to view a list of all finches **from the database** (index view) that displays each of the attributes of a finch.

	- AAU, when I click on a finch card on the index page, I want to be taken to a details page where I can see all attributes of the finch.



## Deliverable?

#### The final version of `finchcollector` (parts 1 thru 5 combined) will be a deliverable, so do each part and don't fall behind.

Please create a repo named `finchcollector` and commit your code.

The link to the repo will be submitted using the form as explained in the class readme.
