# Finch Collector Lab - Part 3

## Intro

Today in the **Django Class Based Views** lesson, you learned about all of the wonders of Class Based Views, and used them to implement 'Create', 'Update', and 'Delete' functionality for the Cat data resource.

In this lab, you'll do the same, except for a data resource of your choosing.

We have chosen to collect Finches in this example!

FYI, future lessons will expand upon the `catcollector` project, and the labs will expand upon the `finchcollector` project!

#### The final version of `finchcollector` (parts 1 thru 5 combined) will be a deliverable, so do each part and don't fall behind.


## Exercises

Following the steps we took in the **Django Class Based Views lesson**, complete the following exercises:

1. Using Class Based Views, implement the following User Stories:
	- AAU, I want to be able to add a Finch to my list of Finches

	- AAU, I want to be able to add edit the attributes of a Finch

	- AAU, I want to be able to remove a Finch from my list of Finches


## Deliverable?

#### The final version of `finchcollector` (parts 1 thru 5 combined) will be a deliverable, so do each part and don't fall behind.

Please create a repo named `finchcollector` and commit your code.

The link to the repo will be submitted using the form as explained in the class readme.
