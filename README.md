### Link to Recorded Lessons

For your convenience, links to the recordings of the lessons will be maintained in this file in the `resources` folder of the class repo:  
 [Links to the Recorded Lessons](./resources/recorded-lessons.md).
 
### Link to Deliverables & Daily Code Challenges on Google Classroom

A **Deliverable** is an assignment that is required to be submitted.  Although not all labs/homework are required to be submitted as deliverables, they are still to be completed when assigned since they provide the necessary practice for the lessons taught.

Graduation requires that 80% of deliverables be completed and delivered on time.

All deliverables are assigned a point value - **if a deliverable is submitted late, half of the point value will be awarded.**

All submitted deliverables must "work" and meet the minimum requirements - they are graded as pass/no-pass.

Your instructors will use [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com/u/0/h) to assign deliverables and you will use [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com/u/0/h) to submit the link to each completed deliverable.

Please click [this invite link](https://classroom.google.com/c/NTM0MDgyNzYxMjg4?cjc=zmhatnl) to join the Google Classroom!

### Daily JavaScript Code Challenges (Deliverables)

There are 30 required code challenges that will help you get the necessary learning on:

- Algorithmic thinking (how to solve problems by breaking it into a series of steps)
- Features & methods available in JavaScript
- Tips, tricks, techniques & approaches of solving specific problems.

Each challenge is assigned in Google Classroom and is implemented on [replit.com](https://replit.com).

It is **highly recommended that you complete one code challenge per day** during the first 30 days of class, excluding project weeks.  You wll have up to 3 days to submit each challenge, however, you will benefit by completing each challenge on or near the day that it is assigned.

Solution code is provided with each challenge.  It is recommended that you review the solution(s) AFTER you have solved the challenge on your own - reviewing the solutions will often provide new techniques to solving problems.  If you find yourself stuck after working hard to solve the challenge on your own, feel free to peek at the solutions for help, however, always take the time to fully read and understand each line of code of the solution code works.

Let's solve day 1's solution together!

### Becoming Familiar With the SEI GitHub Workflow

#### Forking (copying) the GA Class Repo to Your GitHub Account

You will have read-only access to the GA class repo.  However, you most certainly will want to be able to make changes (e.g., add notes, save code exercises, etc).  These changes will be saved to your own personal copy of GA's Student repo - known as a **fork**. To get this fork do the following:

1. Make sure that you're logged in to your GA **Enterprise** GitHub account. If you have not signed up yet, here's the link to do so: [https://git-invite.generalassemb.ly](http://git-invite.generalassemb.ly)
2. In another tab, browse to the GA class repo:  [https://git.generalassemb.ly/SEI-CC/SEI-06-21-22](https://git.generalassemb.ly/SEI-CC/SEI-06-21-22)
3. In the top-right corner of the page, click the `Fork` button.
You now have a copy of the repo in **your** Enterprise GitHub account!

#### Cloning Your Copy of the Repository Locally

Now that you have a copy of the class repo in your GitHub account, it's time to bring the contents of that repo onto your computer - this process is known as **cloning** and it only needs to be done once:

1. On your Enterprise GitHub account, browse to your fork of the GitHub class repo and under the repository name click `Clone or download`
2. In the `Clone with HTTPS` section, click the clipboard to copy the URL for the repository.
3. Open Terminal and navigate to your `~/code` folder - you may choose a different folder if you wish, however these instructions will assume you clone the repo into a folder named `code`.
4. In Terminal, type `git clone ` and follow it by pasting in the copied URL from the clipboard. The command should now look something like this:

```
$ git clone https://git.generalassemb.ly/YOUR-ENTERPRISE-GITHUB-USERNAME/SEI-CC/SEI-06-21-22
```

You can now `$ cd SEI-06-21-22` and check out your local copy of of the GA class repo!

#### Adding a git _remote_ for the original/source GA class repo

A repo on your computer is called a **local repo** ("repo" is short for repository).

Repos on GitHub are called **remote** repos. Think of them as repos in the cloud.

When you cloned your fork of the repo, a "link" to the git **remote** was automatically created. You can check which remotes exist for a given local repo using this command:

```
$ git remote -v
```

Note that by convention, the remote that points to the GitHub repo it was cloned from is named **origin**.

However, in order to get the updates that the instructors push to the GA class repo, you will need to create another **remote** that points to GA's class repo that you forked:

```
$ git remote add upstream https://git.generalassemb.ly/SEI-CC/SEI-06-21-22.git
```

Note that by convention, the remote that points to the *original* GitHub repo that was forked is named **upstream**.

Entering `$ git remote -v` again will show that you now have two remotes: `origin` (your fork of GA's class repo) and `upstream` (GA's class repo).

#### Getting Changes Pushed by Your Instructors

Instructional materials are regularly pushed to the class repo by your instructors. You will want to "pull" these materials into your local repo (on your computer). Doing so will enable you to access "starter code", etc.

First, if you've made any changes **within** the repo locally, i.e., you've modified some starter code, you will need to **commit** those changes first:

```
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Add amazing work..."
```

With local changes committed, you can now fetch the updates from the Github class repo and merge them into your **local** repo (on your computer):

```
$ git pull upstream main
```

From time to time, you will want to "save" the commits you have made locally to your forked GitHub class repo (in the cloud). Doing so is a good idea to ensure your work is backed up to the cloud in case of computer failure:

```
$ git push origin main
```

The overall Git/GitHub workflow is summarized by this diagram:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/OryAQVa.png">

#### Git Merge Conflicts

A **merge conflict** occurs when git merges two commits that have modified the same region of code and can't figure out whose code to use. Thus, fixing merge conflicts requires that a developer manually update the code to what it should be and re-commit it to resolve the conflict, which will also finish git's merge process.

Git informs you which files have merge conflicts and will *annotate* your code to show you how your local code differs from the code being merged from the remote. An example of such annotation is below.

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
// Local code is here 
=======
// Changes you are pulling are here
>>>>>>> 75c37cea922afc56e7d686adba063b986013ca9f
```

Once you have resolved these merge conflicts by editing the code and removing the markers, you can `add` and `commit` normally.

During group project merge conflicts will likely occur giving you an opportunity to learn more about them then.

#### Important

**"Nested" repos are never permitted**.  Therefore, if you have important code, such as your projects, that belongs in its own repo, **be sure to put that code in folders outside of the class repo**.

### Additional Coding Practice Resources

If/when you find yourself with extra time, and assuming you are caught up with your Daily JavaScript Code Challenges, look into these external resources:

#### edabit

[edabit](https://edabit.com/challenges/javascript) is a great practice site and has lots of challenges designed for beginners!

#### codewars

[codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) is an excellent source of coding challenges for numerous programming languages.

It's free, so be sure to create an account so that you can track your progress.

Code challenges (called _Kata_) vary in difficulty from "8kyu" (easiest) to "1kyu".

#### Interview Cake

Designed to prep you technical interviews, [Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com/) comes highly recommended.

It's not free, however, you should take advantage of its free 7-day email crash course and decide to if its worth the bucks to you.

### GA SEI Graduation Requirements

General Assembly's courses are pass/fail programs. We have certain requirements in order to be considered a graduate of the SEI program:

- No more than 3 days absent from class over the duration of the course (3 tardies or early departures equals 1 absence)
- Successful completion of all four assigned projects (one each unit).
- Each project also consists of a Project Assessment (sort of a mini-code challenge).  Passing 3 of the 4 project assessments is a requirement to pass the course.
- If you fail any part of a project (the project requirements, or the project assessment), you can resubmit that part **once**.  For example, if you re-take Project 1's Assessment, no other resubmitals are permitted.
- No violation of GA's zero tolerance plagiarism policy.
- Participating in GA’s mid-course and end-of-course feedback surveys
- Complete 80% of assigned "deliverables"

When you complete our program with passing status, you unlock our alumni perks:

- Receive a GA Letter of Completion (via email approximately 1 week after graduation).
- Post-grad support by your Outcomes Team.
- Credits and discounts for other GA courses (check with Student Services for details).
- Access to our Alumni Community
